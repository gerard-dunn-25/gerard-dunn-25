### Kia Ora! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Gerard, but most people call me Gerry! 

âš¡ I'm a creatively driven individual with a unique blend of experience across marketing & advertising, audio production, and most recently, full-stack web development. 

ðŸ”­ After earning a degree majoring in Marketing and Advertising and completing a Certificate in Audio Production & Sound Engineering, I spent several years working with Auckland Council across various portfoliosâ€”building strong communication, stakeholder engagement, and interpersonal skills.

ðŸŒ± Recently, I decided to take the leap into tech and completed Dev Academy Aotearoaâ€™s software development bootcamp. Over 15 intensive weeks, I developed practical skills in modern web technologies, while also strengthening my collaboration, communication, and agile teamwork abilities.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m now looking to bring my multidisciplinary background and fresh technical skills into a dynamic, values-driven organisation - especially one that values creativity, purpose, and growth.
